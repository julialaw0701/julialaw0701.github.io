  - Hover over "Open with..."
  - Select your code editor (to change code) OR chrome (to see it)
  - Whenever you change your code, make sure to refresh the chrome page

  Method Two:

- Opening index.html from VS code:

- [ ] Finish the 'What is one thing that I learned from doing this project?' in the readme

### Tips :tipping_hand_woman:

- We highly encourage you to follow practice the exercises; reading about code is not always enough, sometimes it's also important to practice implementing the specific steps. Don't worry if it feels difficult - that's normal. The important thing is to keep going, even when it feels hard :relaxed:

- If you get stuck, try to break down the problem. What small thing can you figure out first? Remember, instructors have a no touching your key board rule (we can help guide you, but won't debug for you!). Part of being a software engineer IS solving problems. It's a marathon, not a sprint :running_woman:

- Other debugging tips
  - [ ] Write down the logic of your code
  - [ ] Re-read documentation
  - [ ] Look at example code on github
  - [ ] Go slow. Do one thing at a time. You got this :muscle:
